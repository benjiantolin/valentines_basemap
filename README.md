### Introduction
This base map is designed to be Valentine's Day chocolate themed. Various shades of chocolate represent  land features, while a heart icon pattern with customized pink coloring, blanket the water layer. The Hurshey's font was imported into Mapbox Studio to resemble a famous chocolate bar company's font. This base map was based off of the Mapbox Basic Template.
